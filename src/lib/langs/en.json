      "q_6": "If I want to upgrade my license, do I just have to pay the difference in price?",
      "q_7": "Are there any restrictions if I want to withdraw my money?",
      "q_8": "Ok. If I pay for the license, then I only pay the MEV ETH Bot fee and no more hidden fees? ",    
      "q_9": "I would like to test the MEV ETH Bot before I buy it. Do you have a Trial version",
      "q_10": "The MEV ETH Bot uses all funds in Bot`s wallet for Mempool attacks? Any tokens?  ",

      "q_16": "If I'm not satisfied with something, can I get my money back for the license?",
      "q_17": "Do you have a telegram chat room where I can chat with your customers? ",
      "a_1": "MEV ETH Bot uses a neural network to find attack opportunities. <br> The MEV ETH Bot tracks transactions on the selected decentralized exchanges and finds among these transactions large orders that affect the liquidity in the pool and the price of the token. With an increased transaction fee, it makes a purchase of the same token slightly earlier and at a lower price. Once a large order goes into the blockchain. The price of the token in the liquidity pool increases. And immediately the MEV ETH Bot sells the token at a profit. The bot earns 0.5-20% from each transaction on these Mempool attacks. The bot can make up to 20 or more such deals per work cycle. In automatic mode and with minimal risk",                 
      "a_2": "Profit depends on the availability of liquidity on decentralized exchanges, bot settings, chosen money management strategy, license and the size of your capital. (the larger it is, the more Mempool attacks MEV ETH Bot will be able to perform and the higher the profit will be). <br> On average, the profit is about 3-5% per work cycle with sufficient capital.",
      "a_3": "Yes, of course. You can track all INVADER BOT transactions on the blockchain.

The cost of the license is paid separately. This is the amount of reward for the MEV ETH Bot's team, and initial setup and startup fee.",
      "a_6": "There is no possibility to upgrade licenses. MEV ETH Bot uses individual algorithms for each license type. If you want to upgrade to a new license, you will have to pay the full license fee and create a separate account and wallet for the new license. <br> Only transferring the license to another wallet is possible. ",
      "a_7": "You can withdraw funds from the bot wallet at any time. After the bot is launched, the funds are temporarily blocked. And you need to wait for the end of the working cycle.  The duration of the work cycle can be set in the MEV ETH Bot settings.",
      "a_8": "Yes, that's right.  The license is a one-time fee per year.  There are no hidden fees. Everything is out in the open. You only pay the MEV ETH Bot's fee of the profits you make.",
      "a_9": "Trial version with full functionality of Start license is available to every user.  But the bot's commission is 15% of the profit made and the bot's work is limited to one 12-hour work cycle. ",

      "a_11": "Earning profits with Mempool attacks has almost no risks. There are small global risks, such as hacking of decentralized exchanges or sudden collapse (scam) of some tokens. But since MEV ETH Bot does not trade on a \"all-in-one\" basis, but divides its capital into parts in order to reduce risks and make more Mempool attacks, there is no danger.",
      "a_12": "No, you do not need to create any accounts. Authorization on decentralized exchanges goes through the WEB 3.0 protocol via a wallet. The MEV ETH Bot automatically connects to decentralized exchanges and makes transactions directly through smart contracts of decentralized exchanges.",
      "a_13": "We share the philosophy of crypto-evangelicals and believe that decentralization gives freedom from dictates and violence from the governments. We support the complete anonymity of our clients and do not require any KYC procedures.",
